# Welcome


Hello! My name is Noah Zipin and I am currently a second-year student pursuing a Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Maryland, College Park. This portfolio is designed to supplement my resume and demonstrate my practical experience in engineering. 

I'm interested in the field of robotics and how it can solve the world's Grand Challenges, like addressing climate change, advancing personalized learning, or solving critical issues in medicine.

I have had the opportunity to participate in many projects, both in and out of the classroom, which have not only improved my technical skills but also my ability to think critically and solve problems efficiently. 
It is my hope that this will allow you to better assess how my skills can be applied to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration!
