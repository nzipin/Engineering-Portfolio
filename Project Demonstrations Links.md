## Self Balancing Robot Project:

I've created an in-depth Youtube Series that showcases my 2-wheeled self balancing robot. Each video dives deep into the engineering design process. I explain the reasons behind every decision, discuss the engineering theroy, and teach the audience how to create a project like this for themselves.
